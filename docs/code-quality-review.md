# Code Quality Review & Improvement Plan

## 1. Best Practices üéØ
- [x] Type Safety Improvements
  - [x] Replace `useState<any>` with specific types in:
    - [x] `ProfileTab` - Uses proper types for profile state
    - [x] `TeamTab` - Updated with proper TeamMember type
    - [x] `TeamManagement` - Updated with Team, TeamMember, and Organization types
    - [x] `TicketForm` - Updated with TicketFormState and related interfaces
  - [x] Add interfaces for all form state objects

- [x] Form Action Consolidation
  - [x] Create shared utilities for:
    - [x] Form data validation using Zod
    - [x] Async error handling
    - [x] Form submission patterns
