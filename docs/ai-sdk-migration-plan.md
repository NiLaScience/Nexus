# AI SDK Migration Plan

## Current State Analysis
- [x] Created initial `candidate-workflow.ts` with basic orchestration
- [x] Have working but fragmented implementation across:
  - Frontend (`CandidatesPage`)
  - API routes
  - Database operations
  - Basic workflow state management

## 1. Core Workflow Components
- [x] Implement missing feedback processing modules:
  - [x] `feedback-processor.ts`:
    - [x] `analyzeFeedbackPatterns()`: Implemented with AI-based analysis
    - [x] `shouldRefineBasedOnFeedback()`: Implemented decision logic
    - [x] `generateCriteriaRefinements()`: Implemented AI-based refinement
    - [x] Added proper error handling and logging
  - [x] Added TypeScript types for all feedback-related functions

## 2. State Management & Database Integration
- [x] Create state management module:
  - [x] Created `state-manager.ts` for centralized state operations
  - [x] Added state persistence in Supabase
  - [x] Implemented state loading and updating functions
  - [x] Added proper error handling for state operations

- [x] Enhance database operations:
  - [x] Created workflow state tables in Supabase
  - [x] Added functions for aggregated feedback storage
  - [x] Added functions for criteria refinement history
  - [x] Implemented proper error handling and retries

- [x] Update workflow orchestration:
  - [x] Modified `candidate-workflow.ts` to use new state manager
  - [x] Added proper criteria formatting
  - [x] Added comprehensive error handling
  - [x] Added detailed logging

## 3. API Layer Refactoring
- [x] Refactor `/api/candidate-matching/route.ts`:
  - [x] Integrated `runCandidateWorkflow`
  - [x] Removed direct candidate generation logic
  - [x] Added proper error handling and status codes
  - [x] Added logging for debugging and monitoring

- [x] Update feedback endpoint:
  - [x] Modified to work with new feedback processing
  - [x] Added support for feedback aggregation
  - [x] Implemented proper validation
  - [x] Added error handling

### Next Immediate Steps:
1. Test API Implementation:
   - [ ] Write unit tests for API endpoints
   - [ ] Test error handling
   - [ ] Test concurrent requests
   - [ ] Test edge cases

2. Update Frontend:
   - [ ] Update state management in CandidatesPage
   - [ ] Add workflow progress indicators
   - [ ] Improve error handling
   - [ ] Add feedback summary view

## 4. Frontend Updates
- [ ] Update `CandidatesPage`:
  - [ ] Modify state management to work with new workflow
  - [ ] Update voting UI to handle feedback properly
  - [ ] Add progress indicators for workflow phases
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling and user feedback

- [ ] Add new UI components:
  - [ ] Workflow progress indicator
  - [ ] Feedback summary view
  - [ ] Criteria refinement display
  - [ ] Error and status messages

## 5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests:
  - [ ] Unit tests for feedback processing
  - [ ] Integration tests for workflow
  - [ ] E2E tests for complete flow
  - [ ] API endpoint tests

- [ ] Add monitoring and logging:
  - [ ] Add telemetry for workflow stages
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring
  - [ ] Add error tracking
  - [ ] Add user interaction logging

## 6. Documentation
- [ ] Update documentation:
  - [ ] Add workflow architecture diagram
  - [ ] Document feedback processing logic
  - [ ] Add API documentation
  - [ ] Update deployment instructions

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1: Core Components** (COMPLETED)
   - ✓ Implement feedback processing
   - ✓ Create state management
   - ✓ Update workflow orchestration

2. **Phase 2: Integration** (COMPLETED)
   - ✓ Refactor API routes
   - ✓ Update database layer
   - ✓ Add error handling

3. **Phase 3: Frontend** (IN PROGRESS)
   - [ ] Update UI components
   - [ ] Add new features
   - [ ] Add E2E tests

4. **Phase 4: Polish**
   - [ ] Add monitoring
   - [ ] Complete documentation
   - [ ] Performance optimization

## Notes
- Keep existing functionality working while implementing changes
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Regular testing throughout implementation
- Document all major changes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Improved feedback processing
- [ ] Better state management
- [ ] More robust error handling
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Monitoring in place
