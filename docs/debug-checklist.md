# Frontend Debugging Checklist

## Build System Issues
- [x] Fix PostCSS configuration
  - [x] Update `postcss.config.js` to use CommonJS syntax instead of ES modules
  - [x] Verify Tailwind and other PostCSS plugins are properly configured

## Client/Server Component Issues
- [x] Fix client component directives
  - [x] Add "use client" directive to `components/chat/chatbot.tsx`
  - [x] Add "use client" directive to settings tab components
  - [x] Verify proper component boundaries between client and server components

## Design Migration Issues
- [x] Clean up duplicate components
  - [x] Remove newly created analytics components
  - [x] Remove newly created settings components
- [ ] Migrate design components
  - [x] Move and refactor Analytics.tsx from design to main app
    - [x] Split into smaller components (TimePeriodSelector, MetricsCards, etc.)
    - [x] Update imports and dependencies
    - [x] Add "use client" directives where needed
  - [x] Move and refactor Settings.tsx from design to main app
    - [x] Split into smaller components (ProfileTab, NotificationsTab, TeamTab, AdminTab)
    - [x] Update imports and dependencies
    - [x] Add "use client" directives where needed
  - [x] Ensure proper Next.js patterns are followed
  - [x] Update all component paths and imports

## Supabase Integration Issues
- [ ] Fix Supabase client cookie handling in `lib/supabase/server.ts`
  - [ ] Update cookie handling to use proper Next.js 14 cookie API
  - [ ] Fix type errors with `Promise<ReadonlyRequestCookies>`
  - [ ] Ensure proper error handling for cookie operations

## Type System Issues
- [ ] Fix module resolution for `@/types/supabase`
  - [ ] Verify path aliases in `tsconfig.json` are working
  - [ ] Ensure type definitions are properly exported

## Component Cleanup
- [x] Remove old component files after migration
  - [x] Removed `TicketList.tsx`, `TicketDetail.tsx`, etc. from root components directory
  - [x] Verified new component structure in appropriate subdirectories

## Route Structure
- [x] Clean up route structure
  - [x] Remove empty `{id}` directory in `app/tickets/`
  - [x] Keep proper `[id]` directory for dynamic routes

## Frontend Rendering
- [x] Temporarily disable Supabase client in `app/tickets/page.tsx`
  - [x] Comment out Supabase client import and initialization
  - [x] Use mock data for initial rendering

## Next Steps
- [ ] Re-enable Supabase client once cookie handling is fixed
- [ ] Implement proper error handling UI for failed Supabase queries
- [ ] Add loading states for data fetching
- [ ] Set up proper type sharing between frontend and Supabase

## Notes
- Keep the design directory until all components are properly migrated
- Focus on getting the frontend to render first before fixing backend integration
- Mock data is in place and working for initial development
- Components should be properly refactored for Next.js, not just copied over
