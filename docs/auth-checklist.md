# Authentication Implementation Checklist

## 1. Supabase Auth Setup
- [x] Verify Supabase Project Configuration
  - [x] Supabase project is created and accessible
  - [x] Auth providers are properly configured
  - [x] Email authentication is enabled
  - [ ] Site URL is correctly set in Supabase dashboard (pending deployment)
  - [ ] Redirect URLs are properly configured (pending deployment)
- [x] Verify Environment Variables
  - [x] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is set and valid
  - [x] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is set and valid
  - [x] No sensitive keys (service_role) are exposed to the client

## 2. Protected Routes Setup
- [x] Identify all routes that should require authentication
  - [x] Dashboard (/)
  - [x] Tickets (/tickets/*)
  - [x] Analytics (/analytics)
  - [x] Settings (/settings)
  - [x] Knowledge Base (/knowledge-base)
- [x] Identify public routes
  - [x] Sign In (/sign-in)
  - [x] Sign Up (/sign-up)
  - [x] Forgot Password (/forgot-password)
  - [x] Reset Password (/reset-password)
- [x] Remove legacy /protected routes
- [x] Verify route protection
  - [x] All app routes properly protected by middleware
  - [x] Auth pages accessible when logged out
  - [x] Auth pages redirect to dashboard when logged in
  - [x] Protected routes redirect to sign-in when logged out

## 3. Middleware & Cookie Configuration
- [x] Implement Supabase cookie-based auth
  - [x] Verify createServerClient is properly configured
  - [x] Confirm cookie management in middleware
  - [x] Test cookie persistence across page refreshes
- [x] Update middleware to protect all app routes except auth pages
- [x] Test middleware redirects:
  - [x] Unauthenticated user visiting protected route → redirected to /sign-in
  - [x] Authenticated user visiting /sign-in → redirected to dashboard
  - [x] Authenticated user visiting / → stays on dashboard
  - [x] Unauthenticated user visiting /sign-in → stays on sign-in
- [x] Verify cookie settings
  - [x] Auth cookies are being set by Supabase
  - [x] Cookies persist after browser restart
  - [x] Cookies are properly secured (HttpOnly, SameSite, etc.)
  - [x] Session refresh works automatically

## 4. Authentication Components
- [x] Verify HeaderAuth component shows correct state
  - [x] Shows Sign In/Up when not authenticated
  - [x] Shows user info/logout when authenticated
  - [x] Updates immediately after auth state changes
- [x] Implement proper loading states during auth operations
  - [x] Sign in loading state
  - [x] Sign up loading state
  - [x] Password reset loading state
- [x] Add proper error handling for auth failures
- [x] Test Supabase auth hooks
  - [x] useUser hook works correctly
  - [x] Auth state updates propagate to components
- [x] Consistent UI across auth pages
  - [x] Sign in page styling
  - [x] Sign up page styling
  - [x] Forgot password page styling
  - [x] Reset password page styling

## 5. Auth Flow Testing
- [ ] Test Sign Up Flow
  - [ ] Valid email/password → creates account in Supabase
  - [ ] Invalid email → shows error
  - [ ] Password too short → shows error
  - [ ] Email already exists → shows error
  - [ ] Successful signup → redirects to dashboard
  - [ ] Verify Supabase session is established

- [ ] Test Sign In Flow
  - [x] Valid credentials → logs in via Supabase
  - [x] Invalid email → shows error
  - [x] Invalid password → shows error
  - [x] Successful login → redirects to dashboard
  - [x] Verify Supabase session is established

- [ ] Test Sign Out Flow
  - [x] Sign out → clears Supabase session
  - [x] Sign out → clears auth cookies
  - [x] Sign out → redirects to sign-in page
  - [x] After sign out, protected routes are inaccessible

- [ ] Test Password Reset Flow
  - [ ] Request reset → sends email
  - [ ] Invalid email → shows error
  - [x] Reset page protected by valid recovery session
  - [ ] Reset link works
  - [ ] Password requirements enforced
  - [ ] Success → redirects to sign-in

## 6. Session Management
- [x] Verify Supabase session persistence
  - [x] Session survives page refresh
  - [x] Session survives browser restart
  - [x] Session properly expires after inactivity
  - [x] Verify session token rotation
- [x] Test session renewal
  - [x] Session automatically refreshes when needed
  - [x] No unnecessary session refreshes
  - [x] Session refresh maintains user state

## 7. Security Checks
- [ ] Verify no auth tokens are exposed in:
  - [ ] URLs
  - [ ] Console logs
  - [ ] Network requests (except to Supabase)
  - [ ] Local storage (should use cookies instead)
- [x] Protected auth routes
  - [x] Reset password requires valid recovery session
  - [x] Auth callback handles errors properly
  - [x] Proper redirects for invalid sessions
- [ ] Verify Supabase RLS policies
  - [ ] Appropriate policies for each table
  - [ ] Policies tested with different user roles
- [ ] Check secure cookie settings
  - [ ] HttpOnly flag set
  - [ ] Secure flag set in production
  - [ ] SameSite attribute properly configured

## 8. Edge Cases
- [ ] Test concurrent sessions
  - [ ] Sign in from multiple tabs
  - [ ] Sign out from one tab affects all tabs
  - [ ] Verify Supabase session consistency
- [ ] Test session recovery
  - [ ] After connection loss
  - [ ] After long sleep/hibernate
  - [ ] After token expiration
- [ ] Test with browser features
  - [ ] Works with cookies disabled → shows appropriate message
  - [ ] Works in incognito mode
  - [ ] Works with localStorage disabled

## 9. Performance
- [ ] Measure and optimize auth operations
  - [ ] Sign in response time < 1s
  - [ ] Sign up response time < 1s
  - [ ] Session check doesn't block page load
  - [ ] Minimize Supabase auth API calls
- [ ] Optimize cookie operations
  - [ ] Minimize cookie size
  - [ ] Efficient cookie updates

## 10. Documentation
- [ ] Document Supabase auth implementation
- [ ] Document auth flows and session management
- [ ] Document common auth issues and solutions
- [ ] Document environment setup requirements
